This project explores the relationship between life expectancy, GDP, and education levels using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical data, and the application of normalization and standardization methods to prepare the data for further analysis. Ultimately, the project aims to provide insights into how economic and educational factors influence life expectancy across different countries.
